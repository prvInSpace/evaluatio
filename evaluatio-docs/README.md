# Evaluatio Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Evaluatio library!

## Documentation philosophy

The documentation for Evaluatio should not only serve as the hub for the API of the project, but also as a go-to resource for how to do evaluation, comparisons, and statistical testing properly.

As such, documentation should not only include information on how to use the functions, but also the context for when and how to use it, when not to use it, implementation details to be aware of, examples, common pitfalls, etc.

We also accept documentation of metrics that are not included in the library provided that they serve to further the vision of the project and improving the state of evaluations.

## Project and library design
For the philosophy of the project, please see the [project and design philosophy document](project/design_philosophy.md)

## Contribution Guide
We follow the principle that there is always space for more people in the community and that everyone has something to contribute, so if you want to contribute, please feel free to get in touch and read our [contribution guide](project/contributing.md) :)

## Documentation guidelines
If you want to contribute to the documentation, you are more than welcome to, but please bear the following in mind.

### Use British English
I felt it had to be said, but please use British English and please uses s'es instead of z's where applicable.

### Use references were available
Where academic literature is available to verify claims, please use the bibliography to cite it.
